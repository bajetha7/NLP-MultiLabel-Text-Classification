# NLP MultiLabel Text Classification

### 
In Multilable classification, multiple categories are associated with same data. It assigns to each sample a set of target variable.
I have recieved this dataset as an assignment to predict the labels of a given paragraph of text.

## Objective 
The obejctive was to predict the labels of a given paragraph of text with classification probability.

## Type of data
Data set contains three files.

1) train_data.csv : This training file contains two fields <text, id>.
The text is the input data and id is a number that maps the text to its corresponding labels in train_label.csv

2) train_label.csv : This label file contains two fields <id, label>.
The id should be used to map the label to corresponding input text in train_data.csv

3) test_data.csv : This test file contains two fields <text, id>.
The text here is the test data for which classification probabilities need to estimated.
